			<h3>Hey, I'm Christie, and I'd like to call myself an aspiring front-end and design engineer.</h3>
			<p>I am currently a Junior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems. I previously studied Mechanical Engineering, but after being exposed to coding in college, I became more interested in how our interactions with computers impact our lives. I picked up a Human-Computer Interaction minor and began to delve myself in topics such as user experience and human-centered design.<br><br>Outside of my academic career, I am involved in Greek Life, A Cappella, Student Body, where through my outside activities, I have been able to really learn what qualities are in a good leader. In my free time, I love to paint, watch shows that make me think in deep or abstract ways, and cook (Cooking for yourself can really have a huge, beneficial impact on your health).</p>
			<p>Definitely reach out to me if you have any questions for me or just want to have a conversation. I love to learn about the different backgrounds people have and the experiences that shape who they are. I'm always open to learn new perspectives :)</p>
