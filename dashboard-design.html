				<h2>PennDOT dashboard design</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="project-desc">
				<p>In this project, I designed a dashboard interface that fits in a typical laptop screen size and displays critical road conditions for PennDOT officials. The assignment was to create a single, non-scrolling information display with simple animations that allow the viewer to process and understand information at a glance. After multiple iterations and critiques within my Interaction Design Overview course, I developed a final design and animation, using Adobe Illustrator and AfterEffects, that shows how the dashboard displays the alerts.</p>

			<h4>Process Sketches</h4>
			<p>For the assignment, we were given eight situations and were to choose a minimum of five situations to display on the dashboard interface. In my pencil sketches, I explored different ways of representing the data:</p>

			</div>
			<p>After the first critique of our pencil sketches, I really focused on the layout and representation of data. Some things I considered for the first iteration of my digital sketches are:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Using symbols to represent data</li>
				<li>Organizing conditions into a clear layout</li>
				<li>Alerting officials in an effective way</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Digital Sketches</h4>
			<h5>First Iterations</h5>
			
			<div class="image-sect">

				<img src="images/dashboard-design/iteration1-sketch3.png">
			</div>
			
			<p>After the second critique and seeing my digital sketches compared to my classmates, I realized that including as much information as possible is not effective in representing data. It is better to be creative in the way we represent it instead of putting as many numbers and words to describe the road conditions. My first iteration designs had way too much going on. The colors and the amount of information I provided for each case were distracting. I feel that I did not use whitespace very well within each case. What I do believe I did well in is that in some cases, I created simple symbols that clearly represented what the conditions were.</p>
			
			<h5>Second Iterations</h5>
			
			<div class="image-sect">

				<img src="images/dashboard-design/iteration2-sketch2alert.png">
			</div>
			
			<h6>What worked:</h6>
			<p>I think that I was able to create symbols that clearly showed what each road condition represented. Also, the alerts are very clear as to what need immediate attention.</p>
 
			<h6>What didn’t worked:</h6>
			<p>The information was still very clumped together and the different colors were overwhelming. The different font sizes were distracting as well.</p>
			
			<h5>Third Iterations</h5>
			<div class="image-sect">
				<img src="images/dashboard-design/iteration3-sketch1.png">
				<img src="images/dashboard-design/iteration3-sketch2.png">
				<img src="images/dashboard-design/iteration3-sketch3.png">
			</div>
			
			<h6>What worked:</h6>
			<p>I was able to leave out unnecessary information because I included symbols and images that represented it in a more visually engaging way.</p>
			
			<h6>What didn’t worked:</h6>
			<p>After the third critique, I realized that the numbers I have in each case are not necessary if I had better animations. They distract from the animated symbols and overall dashboard.</p>

			<h4>Final Design and Animation</h4>
			<p>Every section was animated in some way to show how each situation was animated. I chose to show the alert of the Mon Wharf Parking Area, where the parking area must be closed when water level rises to and over 18 feet.</p>
