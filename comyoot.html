				<h2>ComYoot</h2>

				<p>ComYoot is a mobile app that helps users easily share their skills, services and job opportunities within their community. Currently as a Web Frontend Developer and UX intern, I conducted competitive analysis as well as user studies for the ComYoot website that promotes the app. I am working to improve the current website, taking into the account the data I collected from the studies and research.</p>

				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>

				<p>After collecting data and analyzing the website interfaces of both the company and its competitiors, I compiled the information I gathered into a competitive profile matrix.</p>
				
				<div class="image-sect">
					<a href="images/comyoot/competitive-analysis.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/comyoot/competitive-analysis.png"></a>
				</div>
				
				<p>I organized my findings from the analysis into five columns:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Overall UI Design (Rating 1-10; 10 being excellent):</span>
						<ul>
							<li>I rated for each company the overall UI design, taking into account colors, organization of content, visuals, and other elements.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Navigation:</span>
						<ul>
							<li>I took note of the navigation that each website had. Many startups have the one-page website layout broken up into different sections (About Us, How The App Works, etc.). Some provide a navigational bar with links that scroll to the section when clicked while others have no navigation.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span class="bold">Content Hierarchy (Rating 1-5)</span></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I rated each company on how they organized their content and if the order would make sense to users. </li>
						</ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Content Relevance (Rating 1-10)</span></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I rated each company on what content they provided and if the content is relevant to the website's purpose and useful to the user.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><span class="bold">Web Responsiveness (Rating 1-10)</span></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I rated each company on the responsiveness of their website. Responsive design is becoming a necessity to all websites as viewers are visiting webpages from all sorts of devices.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

				<h4>User Studies</h4>
				<h5>Questions for User Studies</h5>
				<p>I conducted about thirty user studies with a set of questions that give insight in what users are looking for in a website. Questions for the User Studies:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>What element do you appreciate most in a website?</li>
					<li>What's your favorite website and what do you like best about it?</li>
					<li>After seeing the company's website, what don't you like about this website?</li>
					<li>For you to click a download link for a mobile app from a website, what message or image would you need to see to convince you that this app will be useful?</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h5>Findings: Questions 1 and 2</h5>
				<p><span class="bold">What element do you appreciate most in a website? What's your favorite website and what do you like best about it?</span></p>
				<p>For these questions, I saw patterns and repetitions in the responses. I organized responses into the following colored categories: </p>
				
				<div class="image-sect">
					<a href="images/comyoot/user-studies-q1q2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/comyoot/user-studies-q1q2.png"></a>
				</div>
				
				<p>The sub-categories from each colored category are simplified versions of the responses I received in the user studies.</p>
				
				<h5>Findings: Question 3</h5>
				<p><span class="bold">After seeing the company's website, what don't you like about this website?</span></p>
				<p>For this question, the majority of the participants' responses fit into the following categories:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>visuals of the app</li>
					<li>visuals of the website</li>
					<li>landing page banner</li>
					<li>website information and message</li>
					<li>key features</li>
					<li>logo</li>
					<li>text legibility</li>
					<li>download section</li>
				</ul>
				<p>One of the biggest problems that participants commented on was that they had no idea what the website was for right when they veiwed the landing page. They did not know the website was promoting the ComYoot app at first. Another common response was that people found the text illegible at certain sections of the website due to the color of the text or background.</p>
				
				<h5>Findings: Question 4</h5>
				<p><span class="bold">For you to click a download link for a mobile app from a website, what message or image would you need to see to convince you that this app will be useful?</span></p>
				<p>For this question, the majority of the participants' responses fit into the following categories:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>visuals of the app</li>
					<li>trust</li>
					<li>focus on user's needs</li>
					<li>app's purpose</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Many participants mentioned that they like to see screenshots of the actual app. Seeing how the app works through these screenshots shows them its usefulness and main functions. Another common response was that they wanted to see reviews of the app from real people, which would establish a sense of trust.</p>

				<h4>Website Mockups and Designs</h4>
				<h5>Insights from Findings</h5>
				<p>I developed several insights from the user studies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Viewers need to see why this app will replace their current actions.</li>
					<li>Visitors prefer to see the app's interface to understand the features.</li>
					<li>Concise, yet informative phrases help visitors understand what the company is offering.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h5>Iteration after iteration</h5>
				<p>I created a few mockups for some of the sections in the website to show the general direction I wanted to take when designing the website. I wanted to follow the minimalistic, clean design (which many participants commented on for Question 1 and 2 of the user studies). The following mockups are for the "Why ComYoot" section, showing the different features and the corresponding screenshots:</p>

				</div>
			</div>

				<h4>Website Creation</h4>
				<h5>Coding the website</h5>
				<p>Currently, I am implementing my designs and coding the website using Bootstrap and JQuery. For the landing section, I used the Bootstrap Carousel:</p>
				<div class="image-sect">
					<a href="images/comyoot/landing-page-1.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/comyoot/landing-page-1.png"></a>
				</div>
				
				<div class="image-sect">
					<a href="images/comyoot/landing-page-2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/comyoot/landing-page-2.png"></a>
				</div>
				
				<div class="image-sect">
					<a href="images/comyoot/landing-page-3.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/comyoot/landing-page-3.png"></a>
				</div>
				
				<p>Currently I am in the process of developing the website, making changes in design elements and adding simple behaviors to the site along the way. Throughout this journey, I hope to continue focusing my decisions and designs on improving the user experience!</p>
