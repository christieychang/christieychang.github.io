				<p>ComYoot is a mobile app that helps users easily share their skills, services and job opportunities within their community. Currently as a Web Frontend Developer and UX intern, I have been conducting competitive analysis as well as user studies for the ComYoot website that promotes the app. I am working to improve the current website, taking into the account the data I collected from the studies and research.</p>

			<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>

			<p>After collecting data and analyzing the website interfaces of both the company and its competitiors, I compiled the information I gathered into a competitive profile matrix.</p>

			<h4>User Studies</h4>
			<p>I conducted about thirty user studies with a set of questions that give insight in what users are looking for in a website. Questions for the User Studies:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>What element do you appreciate most in a website?</li>
				<li>What's your favorite website and what do you like best about it?</li>
				<li>After seeing the company's website, what don't you like about this website?</li>
				<li>For you to click a download link for a mobile app from a website, what message or image would you need to see to convince you that this app will be useful?</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		
		<div class="project-sect">
			<h4>Moving Forward</h4>
			<p>I am using what I learned from both the competitive analysis and user studies to improve the elements of the website, aiming to ensure that the website is conveying its intended meaning.</p>
